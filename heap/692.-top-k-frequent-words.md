# 692. Top K Frequent Words

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return _the _`k`_ most frequent strings_.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 500`
* `1 <= words[i] <= 10`
* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `k` is in the range `[1, The number of `**`unique`**` words[i]]`

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a classic max heap problem, except for we have to think about how to sort two attributes.

note: learn either using [**Comparator**](https://blog.jooq.org/java-8-friday-goodies-lambdas-and-sorting/) or lambda function to sort two attributes. 
{% endhint %}

```java
public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
    Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for(String word : words){
        map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
    }

    PriorityQueue<String> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<String>(
            (w1, w2) -> map.get(w1).equals(map.get(w2)) ?
            w1.compareTo(w2) : map.get(w2).compareTo(map.get(w1)));

    for(Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()){
        maxHeap.offer(entry.getKey());
    }

    List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
    while (k > 0){
        res.add(maxHeap.poll());
        k--;
    }
    return res;
}
```
