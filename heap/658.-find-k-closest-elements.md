# 658. Find K Closest Elements

Given a **sorted** integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, return the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.

An integer `a` is closer to `x` than an integer `b` if:

* `|a - x| < |b - x|`, or
* `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= arr.length`
* `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
* `arr` is sorted in **ascending** order.
* `-104 <= arr[i], x <= 104`

**Example 1:**

```java
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```java
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

This problem can be solved by multiple ways. One way to think about it is to find **top K closest Elements**.

**Whenever we see something like "to find top K elements",** it** **means that this problem be solved by heap

The tricky part about this problem is how to build the PriorityQueue.

```java
public List<Integer> findClosestElements(int[] arr, int k, int x) {
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
        (a,b)-> Math.abs(a-x)==Math.abs(b-x) ? b-a : Math.abs(b-x)-Math.abs(a-x));

    for(int i:arr){
        pq.add(i);
        if(pq.size()>k) pq.poll();
    }

    while(!pq.isEmpty())
        list.add(pq.poll());
    Collections.sort(list);
    return list;
}
```

By using heap, we need to eventually to sort the result list. In this case, the time complexity is O(n log n), which is very slow.

A better way to do it is to use binary search to find the range from start position to k, which will improve the time complexity to O(n) time.
