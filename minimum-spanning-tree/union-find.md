# Union Find and Kruskal

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;We use Union Find to construct disjoint set forest.

It has 3 steps, MAKE-SET -> UNION(set) -> FIND(set)
{% endhint %}

![union find, from CLRS](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The idea of Kruskal's algorithm is do sort the edges based on weight before do union find.
