# 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected



There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n - 1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between computers `ai` and `bi`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return _the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected_. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample\_1\_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove cable between computer 1 and 2 and place between computers 1 and 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/sample\_2\_1677.png)

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough cables.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 105)`
* `connections[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < n`
* `ai != bi`
* There are no repeated connections.
* No two computers are connected by more than one cable.

This problem can be seen as to find an unweighted and undirected connected component.

We can use a simple [union find](./) approach(disjoint-set) to solve the problem.&#x20;

```java
    public int makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections) {
        int[] parent = new int[n];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        int extras = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < connections.length; i++){
            int a = connections[i][0];
            int b = connections[i][1];
            if(union(parent, a, b)){
                extras++;
            }
        }
        int conn = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(parent[i] == i) conn++;
        }
        return conn - 1 <= extras ? conn - 1 : -1;
    }
    
    public int find(int[] parent, int A){
        while(A != parent[A]){
            A = parent[A];
        }
        return A;
    }
    
    public boolean union(int[] parent, int a, int b){
        int roota = find(parent, a);
        int rootb = find(parent, b);
        parent[roota] = rootb;
        if(roota == rootb) return true;

DFS can also be used to traverse all the edges
{% endhint %}

```java
    public int makeConnected(int n, int[][] connections) {
        if(connections.length< n - 1) return -1;
    
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
            graph.add(temp);
        }
        
        //use adj list to build the graph
        for(int i = 0; i < connections.length; i++){
            int k = connections[i][0];
            int j = connections[i][1];
            
            graph.get(k).add(j);
            graph.get(j).add(k);
        }
        
        //run dfs to visit and count each unvisited node and mark it as visited
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int component = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(visited[i] == false){
                component++;
                DFS(graph, visited, i);
            }

        return component - 1;

    public void DFS(List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited, int i){
        visited[i] = true;
        for(int vertex: graph.get(i)){
            if(visited[vertex] != true) DFS(graph, visited, vertex);
