# 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points



You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the **manhattan distance** between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return _the minimum cost to make all points connected._ All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/d.png)

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Output: 20
Explanation: 

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
Output: 18
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
* `-106 <= xi, yi <= 106`
* All pairs `(xi, yi)` are distinct.

simple Kruskal's algorithm

1. build the set of edges based on the weight(manhattan distance) and sort it
2. perform union find to join each edge into the set(sorting ensures that the picked edges from disjoint set are the shortest)
