# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 105`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* All the pairs prerequisites\[i] are **unique**.

{% hint style="info" %}
First determine what kind of graph is this problem.

It is a DAG(direct acyclic graph), then we should think about using Topological sort to solve it.

```java
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        //Kahn's algorithm -- topological sort
        List<Integer>[] adjList = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            adjList[i] = new ArrayList();
        }
        
        //the number of nodes that pointing to the current node is called the indegree of the current node
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        
        for(int[] i: prerequisites){
            adjList[i[0]].add(i[1]);
            indegree[i[1]]++;
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        //add all the nodes that can be the starting node, which means that they do not have indegree into the queue
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            if(indegree[i]==0) queue.add(i);
        }
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int current=queue.poll();
            for(int c: adjList[current]){
                indegree[c]--;
                if(indegree[c]==0)
                    queue.add(c);
            }
            numCourses--;
        }
        return numCourses==0;
    }
```
