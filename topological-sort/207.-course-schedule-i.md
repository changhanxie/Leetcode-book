# 207. Course Schedule I

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 105`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* All the pairs prerequisites\[i] are **unique**.

{% hint style="info" %}
First determine what kind of graph is this problem.

It is a DAG(direct acyclic graph), then we should think about using Topological sort to solve it.

Three Steps to do topological sort.

1. build the adjacency list
2. for each node v, record the number of in-degree and build the adjList for each prerequisite u
3. initial a queue by add all the nodes u to the queue if the do not have in-degree
4. use BFS to check the list of v connected to a node u in the queue by reduce the in-degree of each visited node v. If the in-degree of v is 0, it means that it no longer has any prerequisite, so add it to the queue for next iteration.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        for(int[] i : prerequisites){
            adjList.get(i[1]).add(i[0]);
            indegree[i[0]]++;
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < indegree.length;i++){
            if(indegree[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
        }
        
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int course = q.poll();
            List<Integer> l = adjList.get(course);
            for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++){
                indegree[l.get(i)]--;
                if(indegree[l.get(i)] == 0){
                    q.offer(l.get(i));
                }
            }
           
            numCourses--;
        }
        return numCourses == 0;
    }
}
```
