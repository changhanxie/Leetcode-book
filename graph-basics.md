# Graph Basics

* _Connected_ is usually associated with undirected graphs (two way edges): there is a **path** between every two nodes.
* _Strongly connected_ is usually associated with directed graphs (one way edges): there is a **route** between every two nodes.
* _Complete graphs_ are undirected graphs where there is an **edge** between every pair of nodes.
