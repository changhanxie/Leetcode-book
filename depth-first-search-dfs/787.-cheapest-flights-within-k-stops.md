# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

* There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

  You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return _**the cheapest price** from_ `src` _to_ `dst` _with at most_ `k` _stops._ If there is no such route, return __`-1`.

* **Constraints:**
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `flights[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
  * `fromi != toi`
  * `1 <= pricei <= 104`
  * There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
  * `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
  * `src != dst`

**Example 1:**![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/02/16/995.png)

```java
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: The graph is shown.
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
```



**Example 2:**![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/02/16/995.png)

```java
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: The graph is shown.
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This is _a single source\(start from a given vertex to find all other vertices\) shortest path_ problem. The related algorithms are **Bellman Ford/ Dijkstra** algorithm. 

It can also be solve using **dfs** and **bfs** with **pruning**.
