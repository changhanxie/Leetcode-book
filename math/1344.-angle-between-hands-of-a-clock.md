# 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock

Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the `hour` and the `minute` hand.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= hour <= 12`
* `0 <= minutes <= 59`
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: hour = 4, minutes = 50
Output: 155
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Think about 1 hour has 60 min, which is 360 degree. 360/60 = 6, which is the degree of 1 min.

And, for each 12 hours complete 360 degree, 360/12 = 30, which is the degree of 1 hour.
{% endhint %}

```java
public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
    double mindegree = minutes * 6;
    double hourdegree = ((hour * 60) + minutes) * 0.5;
    
    double diff = Math.abs(hourdegree - mindegree);
    return Math.min(diff, 360 - diff);

}
```
