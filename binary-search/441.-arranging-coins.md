# 441. Arranging Coins

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `ith` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return _the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`

```java
Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int count = 0, step = 1, target = 0;
        while(true){
            n -= step;
            count++;
            step++;
            if(n < step){
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
We can brute force it out by comparing if each row in the matrix is filled.

Or, using binary search to compare n and the summation of all the rows.

we can use [summation function ](../math-related.md)to find the max coins in the rows
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Question: why n < curr?

n: total coins

curr: is the max number of coins in curr number of rows

We need to find the **largest possible** rows that can be filled, which means, we need to find the row contains the largest possible m(m <= n) .

In order to find the largest possible rows, we pick the largest possible row and compress it from the **right** hand side.

in this pattern , left - 1 = right
{% endhint %}

```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long left = 0, right = n;
        
        while(left <= right){
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            long curr = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;
            if(n < curr){
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        //left = right + 1
        return (int)right;
    }
}
```
