# 302. Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `image` where `0` represents a white pixel and `1` represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers `x` and `y` that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return _the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels_.

You must write an algorithm with less than `O(mn)` runtime complexity

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/pixel-grid.jpg)

```
Input: image = [["0","0","1","0"],["0","1","1","0"],["0","1","0","0"]], x = 0, y = 2
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: image = [["1"]], x = 0, y = 0
Output: 1
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `m == image.length`
* `n == image[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `image[i][j]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `1 <= x < m`
* `1 <= y < n`
* `image[x][y] == '1'.`
* The black pixels in the `image` only form **one component**.

{% hint style="info" %}
the idea is to find the left most and the right most point as the width, and the top most and the bottom most point as he height. Since a point is given, we can based on it do a binary search for the four points instead of linear search.

linear search for this problem is very straightforward.
